# Investment Strategy Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides tools and analysis for comparing different investment strategies over historical market data, primarily focusing on the S&P 500. We contrast two primary investment approaches: lump-sum investing and dollar-cost averaging, simulating various investment amounts and durations.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical monthly data of the S&P 500 over the last thirty years.
- **Lump-Sum Investing Simulation**: Observe the growth of a one-time investment in the S&P 500 over time.
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging Simulation**: Evaluate the performance of a periodic investment strategy over the same timeframe.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic visual plots comparing the performance of both strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the provided requirements file.
3. Execute the main script to fetch the data and visualize the simulations.
4. Adjust the parameters in the script to test different investment amounts and periods.
