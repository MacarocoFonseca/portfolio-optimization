# Investment Strategy Simulator
## Overview
This project contains Python classes and scripts designed to simulate and compare two popular investment strategies: Lump Sum Investment and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven understanding of how each strategy performs under various market conditions.

## Features
Lump Sum Investment Simulation: Simulates investing a lump sum amount in a given asset or portfolio at a specific point in time.
Dollar-Cost Averaging Simulation: Simulates periodic investments in an asset or portfolio over a specified duration.
Comparative Analysis: Offers tools to compare the outcomes of both strategies over identical time periods and market conditions.
Visualization Tools: Includes functionality to visualize the growth of investments and comparative results over time.

## Modules
Briefly describe each Python module/class and its purpose. For example:

lump_sum.py: Contains the LumpSumInvestment class for simulating lump sum investments.
dca.py: Contains the DollarCostAveraging class for simulating DCA investments.
visualizer.py: Functions for visualizing investment growth and strategy comparisons.
