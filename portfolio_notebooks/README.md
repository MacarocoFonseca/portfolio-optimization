# Portfolios Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that form the core of our Portfolio Analysis project. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific aspect of portfolio analysis and strategy comparison

## Notebooks Overview:
1. **Dollar-Cost Averaging VS Lump Sum Strategies**
[DCA_vs_LumpSum](./DCA_vs_LumpSum.ipynb)
In this notebook, we explore the difference between dollar-cost averaging and lump sum investment strategy. It includes a systematic approach of investing a fixed amount periodically and compares its performance against lump-sum investing over S&P500 or (^GSPC on Yahoo finance).
We can see for a fact that for the majority of the time Lump Sum outperforms DCA with more than 70% of the times.

This notebook provides a detailed simulation of lump-sum investing in the S&P 500 index. It demonstrates the growth of a single, one-time investment over a long period, using historical market data.
